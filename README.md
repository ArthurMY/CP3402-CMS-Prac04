This is the weekly Journey for Practical 4

## Practical 4
### The S.M.A.R.T of the Prac 4
By the end of Practical 4, I had a clear understand of how to demonstrate a dynamic site with a database by following the S.M.A.R.T criteria:

* **Specific:** Focus on learining the key concepts and techniques required to build a dynamic website with a database

* **Measurable:** Measure the progress by successfully completing the practical tasks and achieving the desired outcomes within the givern timeframe.
  
* **Achievable:** Untilizied the resources provided, such as tutorials, documentation, and assistance from instructors, to gain the necessary knowledge and skills for building a dynamic site with a database.
  
* **Relevant:**  This goal aligns with the objective of the practical, which is to understand and demonstrate the principles and techniques of building dynamic websites with database integration.

* **Time-bound:** I will accomplish this goal by the end of Practical 4, which provides a specific timeframe for completion.


### Learning Journey for Practical 4
To start the prac 4, I studied how to locate host the website. 
I watched this video about the local host and how to build up the WordPress webpage and database for the site.
* [How to host a website from your own computer](https://youtu.be/euXdC0NDgac?si=WXUTRlB4Z60SFxi4)

### Estimated hours
I spent around 5 hour completing all the parts. Including downloading and setting up with XAMPP, which a software that can display websites on the internet. 
WordPress is a website content creation tool online. In previous weeks, I already learned how to use it. So I did not make any further learning for it this week. 
There are some issue during XAMPP start up, mySQL service is not able to launch, so it takes some time to fix the issue.
Myphpadmin is easy for build up the database.

### Learning Insights
During the process of this practical, I found out is simple to build up a local host website and set up a database locally. For the moving on step, I will tried to run the installation on virtual machine and try to make it is able to share with teammates as a preparation work for the comming Assignment 2.
