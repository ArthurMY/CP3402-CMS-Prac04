This is the weekly Journey for Practical 4

## Practical 4
### Goal of the Prac 4
This practical is to understand how to demonstrate a dynamic site with a database.

### Learning Journey for Practical 4
To start the prac 4, I studied how to locate host the website. 
I watched this video about the local host and how to build up the WordPress webpage and database for the site.

### Estimated hours
I spent around 1 hour completing all the parts. Including downloading and setting up with XAMPP, which a software that can display websites on the internet. 
WordPress is a website content creation tool online. In previous weeks, I already learned how to use it. So I did not make any further learning for it this week.
